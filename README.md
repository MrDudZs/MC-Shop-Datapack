# MC-Shop-Datapack
 A singleplayer "shop" datapack that adds the multiplayer admin shop experience (Price disputes not included)


## How this works:
This datapack will summon a chest to display a very basic GUI within your world starting with five basic options:
1. Blocks
2. Ores
3. Farming
4. Mob Drops
5. Redstone

## What I aim to do:
I aim for this datapack to add the experience as a multiplayer admin shop plugin to singleplayer.

## Why? 
why not I sometimes don't want to play multiplayer but want the experiences of what I love from servers in to my solo world.

## Can this be used for multiplayer?
After I do some tests with it with servers we will see maybe.
